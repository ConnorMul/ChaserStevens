            <p className="about-details">I truly came into the world in April of 2015. 
                Born again after all my pain into a new version of myself. 
                My heart had broken, I was 19 and alone so i took solace in my journal. 
                Keeping my pain hidden from the world but letting it dance around on paper. 
                Watering my roots so I could grow. 
                5 trips around the sun later, 
                the mist has begun to rise and I can see clearly for miles and miles. 
                Twilight shines through my curtains to remind me to continue my journey.
            </p>

            <p className="about-details">I’m older than i was then. 
                24 to be exact. I’m a bottle blonde. 
                My eyes are still blue, they’ve grown just a bit more tired, 
                not to say they’re less excited, they’ve just seen so much since then. 
                I’ve grown but i’m shaped heavily by my past. 
                I’m living in New York now but my soul belongs to a place unknown.
